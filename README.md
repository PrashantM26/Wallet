Respected Sir/Madam,

A) Steps Taken:

1) Extracted the given folder and created a new eReact project using npx create-react-app appName.
2) Observed the screen and the thing required to import and observed the sample file folder given to understand the structuring required.
3) Getting rid of routing and directly rendered the required component.
4) Observed the components exported, imported and the components on which the required output is dependent on. index.js file present in folders gave insight on what was exported.
5) Removed contexts, filters, layouts and components which are not being rendered. Only the dependencies which are required were installed.
6) Replaced Link tag provided by react-router-dom with <a> tag and devised the functionality of useNavigate and useLocation using suitable methods of window object.
7) Set the base path of vite.config.js to root link.



B) Reason for not abiding with recommended folder structure:

1) I tried to follow the provided folder structure. There were certain certain files with codes that I was not able to infer in the time alloted, so I didn't change the file structure of them.
2) Moreover, all the code files are within src folder and components used are within the component folder. I have tried to only keep context, layouts and assests folders outside the components folder.



C) Reason for not being ble to get rid of all the redundand code before the deadline:

1) I didn't understand working of certain section of code, so I kept them for the end to optimize it. I tried to get rid of as much redundant code as possible. I could have got rid of redundant code in helpers, utils if I could have kept track of time spent.
2) The code for importing and exporting components in index.js files in most folders could have been placed in a single index.js file. I should have kept my pace with the alloted time. I will inculcate the lessons learned.
